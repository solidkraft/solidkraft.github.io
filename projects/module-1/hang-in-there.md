title: Hang In There - Pair
---

## Learning Goals

* Write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data
* Use a provided class by creating object instances using the `new` keyword
* Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
* Understand event bubbling and use event delegation on dynamic elements
* Begin to understand how to write effective, clean HTML & CSS

## Overview

Sometimes you need a pick me up. Remember those motivational posters that were all over the place in classrooms and online? We're going to make our own!

## Set Up

To begin, choose one partner to do the following:

1. Fork the repository found here: [https://github.com/solidkraft/hang-in-there-boilerplate](https://github.com/solidkraft/hang-in-there-boilerplate).
2. Clone down your new, forked repo
3. `cd` into the repository
4. Open it in your text editor
5. Add all project partners and your assigned instructor as collaborators on the repository

Then, as a team:

* Explore the repository to see what's going on in the code
* What pieces of code might you use to complete iterations, and what pieces will you have to create?
* All of your work will take place in `main.js` - you will not need to change any other files.

## Day 1 Deliverables

By the end of the day, complete the following tasks:

* As a team, read the entire project spec and rubric
* Add all teammates and your assigned instructor as collaborators to your forked repository
* Create a private Discord channel with all members of the project and your assigned instructor and share links to:
  - the forked GitHub repo
  - the GitHub Pages deployed site
    - Under your repo's settings, scroll down to GitHub Pages and set it up to deploy your master branch

## Progression

### Iteration 0 - Main Page

![homepage](../../assets/images/projects/hang-in-there/homepage.png)

- When the page loads, we should see a poster with a randomly selected image, title, and quote
- Every time the user clicks the Show Random Poster button, a new random poster is displayed.

### Iteration 1 - Switching Views

Form view:
![form](../../assets/images/projects/hang-in-there/form.png)

Saved posters view:
![saved posters](../../assets/images/projects/hang-in-there/saved.png)

- When a user clicks the "Make Your Own Poster" button, we should see the form, and the main poster should be hidden
- When a user clicks the "View Saved Posters" button, we should see the saved posters area, and the main poster should be hidden
- When a user clicks the "Nevermind, take me back!" or "Back to Main" buttons, we should only see the main poster section
- In summary: Be able to switch between the three views (main poster, form, and saved posters) on the correct button clicks

_Hint: go check out the HTML and CSS files to see how the form and saved posters sections are being hidden in the first place_

## Iteration 2 - Creating a New Poster

Result after clicking save button:
![result](../../assets/images/projects/hang-in-there/form-result.png)

- On the new poster form view, users should be able to fill out the three input fields and then hit the save button
- When the save button is clicked, several things will happen:
  - Save the submitted data into the respective arrays (image URL into the images array, etc) so that future random posters can use the user-created data
  - Use the values from the inputs to create a new instance of our Poster class
  - Change back to the main poster view (hiding the form view again)
  - Display the newly created poster image, title, and quote in the main view

## Iteration 3 - Saving & Viewing Posters

- When a user clicks the "Save This Poster" button, the current main poster will be added to the `savedPosters` array.
- If a user clicks the "Save This Poster" more than once on a single poster, it will still only be saved once (no duplicates)
- When a user clicks the "Show Saved Posters" button, we should see the saved posters section
- All the posters in the `savedPosters` array should be displayed in the saved posters grid section

## Iteration 4 - Deleting Saved Posters

- From the saved posters view, if a user double clicks a saved poster, it will be deleted

_Hint: How will you update the data model to achieve this?_

## Optional Extensions - Gettin' fancy

Here's a list of possible extensions to implement - but **ONLY IF** your team has completed all the previous iterations **AND** have cleaned up your code to make it DRYer and more readable.

You are welcome to add your own extensions. Be sure they are thoughtful in terms of UX/UI, and that they do not break any prior functionality.

- Implement data validation and error handling into the form (disable button, provide error messages if data entered is not correct, etc)
- In the main poster view, allow users to click each piece of the poster (image, title, quote) to update just that piece with another random item from the appropriate array
- When a user single clicks a saved poster, create a modal to view it larger
- Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want them to appear

## Rubric

This rubric should serve as a guide for students as they progress through the project, as well as to self-evaluate. Instructors will use it to evaluate the project at its final due date/time, and provide detailed feedback so students know what areas to focus on in future projects.

Scores land in a range between 1 and 4. Below is a breakdown of what those numbers represent.

* **4 (exceptional)** - went beyond set learning goals; did self-teaching to go above and beyond in this area
* **3 (proficient)** - exactly on track! you're where you need to be in this area! great work!
* **2 (trailing)** - a little behind where we want to see you right now; in a good place to build familiarity/competency in this area; study in this area to level up and grow
* **1 (dragging)** - significantly behind where we want to see you; major growth needs to be shown in this area; set up a pairing session with an instructor as soon as possible

To earn a given score, an application must meet the requirements listed in that score explanation and all scores lower.

### Professionalism

* **4:**
  - Team uses a PR template
  - Team habitually conducts thorough code reviews in the GitHub GUI to document the progress of the application
  - Team has sought out code reviews from one or more mentors
  - README is well formatted and descriptive with screenshots or gifs of the application in action
* **3:**
  - Commits are atomic and frequent, effectively documenting the evolution/progression of the application
  - Commit messages are consistent, descriptive, and concise
  - Team uses PRs to screen/verify code before adding it to the master branch
  - There is no more than a 10% disparity in code contributions between teammates
  - README is well formatted and gives good context about the project, including links to both contributors' GitHub profiles, and to the deployed GitHub Pages site
* **2:**
  - Commits are large and do not effectively communicate the progression of the application
  - Team uses PRs but do not review code before merging into the master branch
  - All teammates can speak to the purpose and functionality of any/every line of code
  - There is a 20% disparity in code contributions between teammates
  - README is brief and does not provide context for the project
* **1:**
  - Teammates do not understand the purpose and functionality of every line of code
  - Some commits are pushed directly to the master branch
  - PRs are used inconsistently
  - There is a 50% disparity in code contributions between teammates
  - There is no README, or README is insufficient

### JavaScript Style & Implementation

* **4:**
  - There are no global variables aside from query selectors, `currentPoster`, `images`, `titles`, `quotes`, and `savedPosters`.
  - All functions strictly adhere to [SRP](http://knnthvu.weebly.com/srp-and-dry.html) and - with few exceptions - are around 10 lines of code or less
  - All functions and variables are semantically and concisely named
  - Uses logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable
  - Code contains no antipatterns
* **3:**
  - Application uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements
  - Functions are [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) and observe [SRP](http://knnthvu.weebly.com/srp-and-dry.html)
  - Functions make use of parameters and arguments in order to be more dynamic
* **2:**
  - Properly uses parameters and arguments when used
  - Uses named functions instead of anonymous functions as event handlers in event listeners
  - Correctly uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic & error handling
* **1:**
  - Crafts JS according to the [SolidKraft Academy style guide](https://github.com/solidkraft/javascript/tree/master/es5)


### Functional Expectations

Functionality is the least important piece of the rubric. It's included because it is another benchmark to gauge proficiency. However, you should not pursue functionality at the expense of code quality or the learning/growth of all team members.

This means, we DO NOT want to see:
- Code that completes iterations but is sloppy
- One or both team members do not understand every single line of code
- One or both team members skips the problem solving process (pseudocoding, talking out the problem, articulating, planning) in the pursuit of completing functionality

* **4:** Applications completes one or more of the extensions without bugs
* **3:** Application completes all the expectations of Iteration 4 without bugs
* **2:** Application completes all the expectations of Iteration 3 without bugs
* **1:** Application completes all the expectations of Iteration 2 without bugs
